# ImageClssifiers_CNN
An attempt to make an image classifier using tensorflow 
The repo contains a ipython notebook which implements the CNN on famous cat vs dog data set of kaggle.
The accuracy is not as high as I hoped back then but I am working on it anyway.
Feel free to suggest improvement as I am relatively noob.
