# ImageClssifiers_CNN
An attempt to make an image classifiers using tensorflow 
The repo contains a ipython notebook which implements the CNN on famous cat vs dog data set of kaggle.
The accuracy is not as high as I hoped back then but I am working on it anyway.
Feel free if you see anyhthing unnecessory and stupid as I am a noob in the field.
